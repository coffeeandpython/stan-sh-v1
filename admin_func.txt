## Data Models & Interfaces

### Core Types (from `types/index.ts`)
```typescript
// Property lifecycle management
Property: address, community, planNumber, stage, status, closingDate, contacts

// Inspection workflow
Inspection: type, status, scheduledDate, inspector, notes, photos, issues

// Personnel management
Inspector: specialties, serviceAreas, workload, performance metrics
Builder: communities, totalProperties, correctionRate, contactInfo

// Admin operations
AdminKPI: metrics for dashboard display
ActivityFeed: system activity tracking
CorrectionRequest: builder-submitted fixes with photos
Report: analytics and data export
```

### Mock Data Structure

- **Correction Requests**: Sample requests with photo attachments

## Design System & UI/UX

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Blue (blue-600, blue-500) for primary actions
- **Success**: Green for completed/passed states
- **Warning**: Orange for in-progress/pending states
- **Error**: Red for failed/urgent states
- **Neutral**: Gray scale for backgrounds and text

### Component Patterns
- **Cards**: Rounded corners (rounded-2xl), subtle shadows, proper spacing
- **Buttons**: Consistent hover states, proper contrast ratios
- **Forms**: Clean inputs with focus states, validation feedback
