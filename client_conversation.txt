## Call Summary

This was a consultation call between Stan, who runs a third-party energy code inspection business for home builders in the DFW area, and Baloo, a freelance developer. Stan processes about 3,000 homes annually across 30-35 municipalities and wants to streamline his current manual, Dropbox-based workflow.

Stan's business involves:
- Energy code compliance calculations and reports for new home permits
- Pre-construction inspections (pre-rock/poly seal)  
- Final inspections and blower door testing
- Managing correction photos from builders
- Issuing compliance letters to builders

He's frustrated with his current manual process and wants automation while keeping costs reasonable. Baloo proposed a custom web application for $8,500-$17,000 with $25/month hosting, and Stan hired him for a $600 initial scoping phase.
